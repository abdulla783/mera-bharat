            <p>n this exercise, the idea is to write a paragraph that would be a random passage from a story. An effective paragraph is one that has unity (it isnâ€™t a hodgepodge of things), focus (everything in the paragraph stacks up to the whatever-it-is the paragraph is about), and coherence (the content follows smoothly). </p>

            <p>Terry didn't consider himself particularly unusual.
